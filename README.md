# arimaa-project

Third-year project as part of my Computer Science bachelors. 

The aim of the project to implement the game of Arimaa, a variant of chess, in C++ through two main iterations; a text-based version played entirely in the console, and then a GUI-version using the Qt graphics framework. The project also involved an AI component, which was implemented using alpha-beta search and other arimaa specific heuristic methods.

The repository contains two folders which are each of the respective iterations. I'm unsure if they are runnable because it was quite a while ago, and I should probably go back and clean it up.

Overall the project was a success, even if the AI part wasn't that good.
